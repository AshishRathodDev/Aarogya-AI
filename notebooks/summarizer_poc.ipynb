It's important to remember that these results are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding your overall health.\n",

      "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):** This measures the amount of hemoglobin in your blood, which carries oxygen throughout your body. Your hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL is within the normal range (13.00-17.00 g/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Total Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count:** This test counts the number of red blood cells in your blood. Your count of 5.0 mill/cumm falls within the normal range (4.50-5.50 mill/cumm).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** This measures the percentage of your blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. Your PCV of 45.0% is within the normal range (40-50%).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** This measures the average size of your red blood cells.  Your MCV of 100.0 fL is within the normal range (83-101 fL).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin):** This measures the average amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell. Your MCH of 30.0 pg is within the normal range (27-32 pg).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration):** This measures the average concentration of hemoglobin in your red blood cells.  This result is not available (nan g/dL) in your report. The normal range is 32.50-34.50 g/dL.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width):** This measures the variation in the size of your red blood cells; this result is not available (nan) in your report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Total White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:** This measures the number of white blood cells in your blood, which fight infection. Your WBC count of 12.0 cumm is within the normal range (11.60-14.00 cumm).  The different types of white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils) were all within or close to their normal ranges.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Platelet Count:** This measures the number of platelets in your blood, which help with blood clotting. Your platelet count of 20000.0 cumm is significantly below the normal range (150000-410000 cumm).\n",
